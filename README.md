# **Report Automation**

✨Created a simple Python script that slightly automates the process of taking information in an Excel file ready to be checked.✨

The script takes in a CSV file with information, processes it by removing unnecessary columns and gets done a some data cleaning, removing N/A cells. All data is well assigned in the original source so there is no need to make any more changes/modifications to the data. 

Then it exports the file in XLSX format ready to work on. This saves time in copy-pasting the same information ID by ID. This also helps in choosing which ID to check, such as, when the status says Failed and/or if it has a report available to be reviewed, these will be saved in the exported Excel, skipping the other IDs that are not needed to take a look at...kind of giving an eagle eye vibes👀(?)

Run the script with:    
```
    🍕python .\IDReports.py \python_test.csv
```
Pizza🍕 not included ofc 👀.
