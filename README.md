# **Report Automation**

âœ¨Created a simple Python script that slightly automate the process of taking information in an Excel file ready to be checked.âœ¨

The script takes in a CSV file with information, processes it by removing unnecessary columns and gets some data cleaning by removing some N/A cells. All data is well assigned in the original file so there is no need to make any more changes/modifications to the data. 

Then it exports the file in XLSX format ready to work on. This saves time in copy-pasting the same information ID by ID and also when choosing which one to check, such as, if it says it's failed and if it has a report available to be reviewed, skipping the others that are not needed to take a look at...kind of giving an eagle eye vibesðŸ‘€(?)

Run the script with:    
    - python .\IDReports.py \python_test.csv
